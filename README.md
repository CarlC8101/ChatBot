# ChatBot

Hello, this is a Chat Bot from Cheng, Chao Hsuan
I got this idea and insperation from Python Engineer. I really appriciate it.

OK then lets get started.
This Chat bot is made for students who would like to apply GMU but have some essential question like due date of application, scholarship, or procedure etc.
Using Pytorch, Cross Entropy Loss function and three-layer model (one layer hidden layer) training data to develop this chat bot. 
Inorder to enhance accuracy and lower cost, this chat bot can be updated automatically. Type-in sentence will be written in patterns if users' type-in sentence is identified greater than 0.75 probability.

Users need to custermize intent.json, and then run train.py, then app.py.
